# Algorithms
In this repository I will add implementations of data structures and different algorithms that I am learning and practicing

Data structures implemented so far:
- implemented a hash table (C++)
- implemented a binary search tree (C++, Java)
- single linked list (Java)


Backtracking:
- not 3 even nor 3 odd: a c++ program that does output in a file all numbers with N digits(N from stdin, N <= 9) that do not have any 3 digits ODD or EVEN


Maths:
- calculated the sum of all primes less than 2 M using the sieve of Eratosthenes (Python)

Exercises:
- reversing an array
- reversing a single linked list
- determine if an input of parentheses is balanced
