# Algorithms
In this repository I will add implementations of data structures and different algorithms that I am learning and practicing

Data structures so far:
- implemented a hash table properly
- implemented a binary search tree



Backtracking:
- NOT 3 even NOR 3 odd: a c++ program that does output in a file all numbers with N digits(N from stdin, N <= 9) that do not have ANY 3 digits ODD or EVEN


Maths:
- calculated the sum of all primes less than 2 M using the sieve of Eratosthenes using python
